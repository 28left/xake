# xake data

Learning records can be downloaded using the `xake data` command.

1) To update your download, you should navigate to the folder of the repository
2) Type `xake data download`. This will either download the records or update the records if they have been downloaded. This is downloaded to `log.sz`.
3) To make the data more readable, use `xake data json` or `xake data csv`. The csv file has much less information than the json file does: identifier, verb, and time. The json file includes all the records that are being recorded.
